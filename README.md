# Installation:
  Just run autorun.bat and choose install, which will install all dependencies listed in package.json via npm (which will have to be installed manually),
  - optional manual installs:
    - git //for automated updates, it will automatically update if the bot is in a git managed directory.
    - ffmpeg //for sound handling in any way, used for the bot soundboard, but can be ignored if not wanted

# Usage:
  run autorunBot.bat // keeps the bot online, restarts when it crashes; Option to stop at error messages for debugging;
  Profit!
